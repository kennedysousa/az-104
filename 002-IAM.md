# Manage Identity and Governance in Azure

[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/) is Microsoft's multi-tenant cloud-based directory and identity management service. Azure AD helps to support user access to resources and applications, such as:

- Internal resources and apps located on your corporate network.

- External resources like Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and SaaS applications.

- Cloud apps developed for your organization.

The following diagram shows an example implementation of Azure AD. In this scenario, Windows Server AD is using [Kerberos](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview) and [NTLM authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview) to on-premises applications.
